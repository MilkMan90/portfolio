      <section id="story">
        <p>
          I've been proudly living in beautiful Denver, Colorado since April, 2016 when I moved from my hometown of Rochester, New York. I love the mountains, the friendly, happy people, the live music, the endless outdoor activities, and of course all the craft beer.</p>
        <p>
          As a web developer, engineer and socially active human, I aim to work and live consciously to better the planent for all of its inhabitants. I believe in the potential for greatness within all people, and that all people deserve an equal shot to actualize that greatness. I enjoy working with diverse teams, being a positive, reliable team member, and having a part in the creation of a better planet.</p>
        <p>
          I'm currently a student in the Front-End Engineering program at the Turing School of Software and Deisgn. When I finish, I hope to work with a team of driven, socially conscious individuals at a company aiming to make the world a more open, healthy, connected, and accepting place.

          </p>
          <p>
            PMD is a custom automation engineering firm, building and designing world class turn-key assembly and test systems for large scale, precise manufacturing across a wide range of industries including automotive, consumer products, energy, medical devices, and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a Software Controls Engineer, my responsibilities included top-to-bottom programming of machine controls including:
            <ul>
              <li>PLCs</li>
              <li>Machine Vision</li>
              <li>HMIs(Human-Machine Interfaces)</li>
              <li>Data Collection</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, as part of the Applications team, I was involved in the front-end design process of machine quoting and feasability testing. I would analyze controls components required for the customers requirements, calculate quotes and work with customers to meet their needs.

            Novel Midi Instrument
          </h4>
          <p>
            Our team of four built a musical instrument called the "Spiderphone", which used an Arduino Uno microcontroller, an ultrasonic distance sensor, and a force sensing resistor along with circuit components to play music based on the distance measured by the sensor. The program was written in C++. We created a demonstration video which you can see below.
